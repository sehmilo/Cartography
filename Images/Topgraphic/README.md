In this tutorial, you created a map that showed popular tourist attractions in downtown Singapore. You created a project, navigated to the area of interest, and added data. You changed the way the map looked and analyzed the distance between tourist attractions and rail stations. Then, you created a layout and exported the map to an image file.

This tutorial was an introduction to ArcGIS Pro and covered only the basics of topics such as mapmaking and analysis.
