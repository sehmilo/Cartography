## Introduction
*“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” ~ Tobler’s First Law of Geography*

 
**Geographic Information Systems** (GIS) is a computer system that helps us see, understand, and work with information about the Earth.

GIS has its applications cut across several fields and disciplines, and can be used to do all sorts of things, like:

- Map the location of things. This could be anything from trees, boreholes, houses within a community, schools, and businesses.
- Analyze patterns and trends. For example, you could use GIS to see how the number of trees in your neighborhood has changed over time.
- Make predictions. For example, you could use GIS to predict where new trees might be planted in the future.
- Communicate information. You can use GIS to create maps, reports, and presentations that help people understand the world around them.
- Suitability Analysis - GIS can be used to help determine the best location to site businesses, factories, and stores.
  
GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to solve all sorts of problems. It's used by a wide variety of people, from scientists to city planners to businesses.
