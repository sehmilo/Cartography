## Introduction
~~The Earth is flat.~~
 
GIS stands for >Geographic Information Systems. It's a computer system that helps us see, understand, and work with information about the Earth.

Imagine you want to know how many trees are in your neighborhood. You could go outside and count them, but that would be a lot of work. With GIS, you can use a map to see where all the trees are, and then count them quickly and easily.

GIS can be used to do all sorts of things, like:

- Map the location of things. This could be anything from trees to schools to businesses.
- Analyze patterns and trends. For example, you could use GIS to see how the number of trees in your neighborhood has changed over time.
- Make predictions. For example, you could use GIS to predict where new trees might be planted in the future.
- Communicate information. You can use GIS to create maps, reports, and presentations that help people understand the world around them.

  
GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to solve all sorts of problems. It's used by a wide variety of people, from scientists to city planners to businesses.
