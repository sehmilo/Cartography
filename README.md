## Introduction
*“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” ~ Tobler’s First Law of Geography*

Over the years I have made maps for personal use, work related, and projects for clients. Below are some of the maps I've made from my earlier GIS days till now.
I have intentionally left the very bad maps to show how I have improved over the years.
